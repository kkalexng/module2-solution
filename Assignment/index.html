<div class = "col-lg-3 col-md-2">
	<h2 id="Chicken"> Chicken </h2>
	<p> Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below. </p>

The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below. </p>
